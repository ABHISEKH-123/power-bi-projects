# Healthcare Data Visualization

This project is for visualizing death figures by World Health Organisation (WHO) across different regions of the world. It is built from Csv data files and provides a comprehensive view of the scale and scope of deaths due to various factors. It provides valuable insights into reason for deaths in different regions over a period of time. The data has been examined on yearly basis and depicts death rates due to wide range of metrics such as smoking, consuming alcohol, drugs abuse, air pollution, household air pollution, vitamin A deficiency etc . 

## Problem statement  

The company has decided to use a Business Intelligence(BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their healthcare data effectively. They have shortlisted Microsoft PowerBi as the BI tool for this project.

The goal of the project is to design and implement a BI solution using Power BI that can help the healthcare company manage and analyze data effectively. The solution should be able to : 

1. Import and Integrate the data into Power BI.

2. Clean and transform the data to make it ready for analysis.

3. Build interactive dashboard and reports using power BI that can help the medical team and management make sense of data.

The solution should be user friendly and easy to use for the medical team and management. The project will be successful if it helps the World Health Organisation effectively manage and analyze the death rate data and improve their decision making.
