It is built from Csv data files and provides a comprehensive view of the scale and scope of financial transactions and sum of revenue. It provides valuable insights into the number of transactions and sum of revenue in five different types of stores over a period of time. It also encompasses a wide range of metrics, including revenue , number of transactions and average age of customers during their transactions in different stores.
